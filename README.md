# Image & Base64 Converter

This project is a web application designed to simplify the process of converting images to Base64 strings and converting Base64 strings back to images. The application is built using vanilla JavaScript for both client-side and server-side handling, with a simple HTML interface. Users can upload images in various formats, generate the corresponding Base64-encoded string, and convert Base64 back into image files for download.

## Introduction

The Image & Base64 Converter allows users to easily work with Base64 strings and image files. Base64 is a commonly used encoding for representing binary data as ASCII text. It is widely used in data URLs for embedding image data directly into HTML or CSS without the need for external resources.

The project offers two main features:
1. **Image to Base64 Conversion**: Upload an image file and receive the corresponding Base64 string.
2. **Base64 to Image Conversion**: Input a Base64 string, and the app will convert it back into an image, allowing the user to download the file.

The project also includes convenient features such as theme toggling between light and dark modes, and switching between English and Chinese language options for the UI.

## Features

1. **Image to Base64 Conversion**:
   - Upload an image in PNG, JPEG, or GIF format, and the tool generates a Base64-encoded string that can be copied and used elsewhere.
2. **Base64 to Image Conversion**:
   - Paste a Base64 string, select the output image format (PNG, JPEG, or GIF), and download the converted image.
3. **Theme Toggle**:
   - Switch between dark and light modes to adjust the interface according to user preference.
4. **Language Toggle**:
   - Switch between English and Chinese to make the application more accessible for users of different languages.
5. **Error Handling**:
   - Includes error messages for unsupported image formats, invalid Base64 data, and failed file uploads.

## How It Works

### Image to Base64 Conversion

When a user uploads an image file, the application reads the file using the JavaScript `FileReader` API. The `FileReader` converts the image into a Base64-encoded string, which can be displayed in the interface or sent to an API for further processing.

1. **File Upload**: The user selects an image file from their local machine.
2. **FileReader**: JavaScript reads the file and converts it into a Base64 string.
3. **Display Result**: The Base64 string is displayed in a text area where users can copy it.

### Base64 to Image Conversion

Conversely, users can input a Base64-encoded string, and the application will decode it back into a binary image file. This is achieved by creating a downloadable image from the Base64 string.

1. **Input Base64**: The user pastes a Base64 string into a text area.
2. **Convert to Image**: The app decodes the Base64 string and creates an image.
3. **Download Image**: The user can download the image in their desired format (PNG, JPEG, GIF).

### Dark/Light Theme Toggle

The interface allows the user to switch between dark and light themes. This is managed through a simple toggle button, which adds or removes the `dark-mode` class from the `body` element, adjusting the CSS properties accordingly.

- **Light Mode**: Default styling with bright background and dark text.
- **Dark Mode**: Inverted colors for a darker interface, reducing eye strain in low-light environments.

### Language Toggle (English/Chinese)

The application offers a language switcher to toggle between English and Chinese. This is implemented using data attributes (`data-lang`) on the HTML elements, and the text is dynamically updated based on the selected language.

- **Default Language**: English.
- **Alternative Language**: Chinese.

The JavaScript `translations` object contains the text for each language, and the `toggleLanguage` function updates the content when the user switches between languages.

## Installation

This project can be deployed in multiple environments. You can run it locally on a Node.js-based server, deploy it on a cloud service like Cloudflare Workers, or serve it using any static web server.

### Prerequisites

- **Node.js** (for local development)
- Basic knowledge of HTML, JavaScript, and working with HTTP requests.

### Steps for Local Installation

1. Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/image-base64-converter.git
    cd image-base64-converter
    ```

2. If you're running the application locally, serve the project using a tool like `http-server`:
    ```bash
    npm install -g http-server
    http-server .
    ```

3. Open the application in your browser:
    ```
    http://localhost:8080
    ```

For deploying on **Cloudflare Workers**, the code is already compatible with Workers' environment. You just need to deploy it through your Workers dashboard.

## Usage

### Uploading an Image

1. **Select an image** from your computer using the file input element.
2. Choose the format (PNG, JPEG, or GIF) from the dropdown.
3. Click the "Upload and Convert to Base64" button.
4. The Base64 string will be generated and displayed in the output box. You can copy this string for use elsewhere.

### Converting Base64 to Image

1. Paste the **Base64 string** into the designated text area.
2. Select the desired output format (PNG, JPEG, or GIF).
3. Click the "Convert and Download Image" button to download the image.

### POST Request for Image Upload

You can also upload an image via a `POST` request to the `/upload` endpoint:

#### Example:

```bash
curl -X POST -F "image=@/path/to/image.png" http://localhost:8080/upload
```

#### Response:

```json
{
  "base64": "<Base64_String>"
}
```

## API Endpoints

### GET Request

- **Method**: `GET`
- **Description**: Returns the main HTML page with the user interface for uploading images and converting Base64 strings.

### POST Request

- **Method**: `POST`
- **Endpoint**: `/upload`
- **Description**: Accepts an image file in the request body and returns the Base64-encoded string of the uploaded image.

#### POST Request Parameters:
- `image`: The image file to be uploaded.
- `format`: (Optional) The desired output format for the Base64 string (PNG, JPEG, GIF).

### Error Handling

The project includes error handling for the following cases:
- **Unsupported Image Format**: Returns a 400 error if the uploaded image format is not supported.
- **Missing Image**: If no image is provided in the request, a 400 error is returned.
- **Invalid Base64 String**: When converting Base64 to an image, the app checks for valid Base64 data.

---

## Technical Details

### Handling Requests

The project listens for fetch events (such as user requests) using the `addEventListener` method. It processes `GET` and `POST` requests differently:
- **GET Requests**: Serve the HTML page.
- **POST Requests**: Handle image uploads and return Base64 data.

### Handling Image Uploads

When an image is uploaded via a `POST` request to the `/upload` endpoint, the image is processed using `FormData`. The server reads the image file, converts it to an ArrayBuffer, and then converts that ArrayBuffer to a Base64 string.

### Handling Base64 Conversion

The `arrayBufferToBase64` function takes an `ArrayBuffer` (binary representation of the image) and converts it into a Base64 string. The reverse process is handled by `base64ToArrayBuffer`, which decodes a Base64 string back into binary data.

### Theme and Language Toggle

These two features are controlled entirely on the client-side using JavaScript. The theme toggle switches between light and dark mode by applying a class to the `body` element,

 and the language toggle updates the text of various elements based on the selected language using the `translations` object.

## Optimization

There are several optimizations that can be implemented to improve the performance of the application:
- **Lazy Loading**: Delay loading of non-essential resources to speed up initial load times.
- **Image Compression**: Compress the images before converting them to Base64 to reduce the size of the Base64 string.
- **Caching**: Cache frequently used resources (like CSS or JavaScript files) to improve performance.

---

## Potential Improvements

Here are some potential areas of improvement for the project:
1. **Image Size Limitation**: Enforce a size limit on the uploaded image to prevent the system from handling excessively large files.
2. **Advanced Error Handling**: Add more descriptive error messages and user feedback for different scenarios (e.g., network issues, large files).
3. **Responsive Design**: Improve the UI to be more mobile-friendly by adjusting the layout and components for smaller screens.
4. **Drag and Drop Support**: Implement a drag-and-drop interface for uploading images.
5. **Custom Base64 Prefix**: Allow users to specify custom Base64 prefixes (e.g., for embedding in HTML or CSS directly).
6. **Asynchronous Error Handling**: Improve error handling for asynchronous operations, particularly for file reading and image processing.
